   There are many people across the United States that struggle to find exercise and dietary programs that are sustainable as well as meet all of their personalized needs whilst they are recovering from an injury. Every body is different, and as such, will require tracking many different factors such as what kinds of foods they are eating, their caloric intake, their activity levels, and their exercises in order for each individual to properly heal themselves. Furthermore, every individual will have different goals that they wish to meet which will require different exercise and dietary restrictions. For example, individuals who are looking to lose weight to assist with their physical ailments (some examples being joint pain and/or sleep apnea) are going to have very different diets and exercise habits compared to individuals attempting to recover from an injury or surgery. Individuals' lack of knowledge, and the difficulty of finding personalized guidance in terms of diet and exercise can lead to feelings of frustration and hoplessness in individuals who might not have access to the knowledge or support needed to create a personalized diet and exercise program that they need to succeed. My hope with this software is to solve this issue by providing individuals access to reliable information from practicing nutritionists, doctors, and physical therapists who can properly advise them on their individualized nutritional and physical needs. Another hope for this software is that it will be able to help individuals easily track their nutrition through tracking macronutrients and caloric intake, as well as help them to build personalized therapy programs which align with their individual needs and goals. 

   This problem is one which is situated in many different fields of interest, some of the key fields including personalized health, nutrition science, exercise physiology, and physical therapy. Behavioral sciences and understanding how to form new habits and break old ones could be useful in identifying and solving the problem, as well. Professionals from many fields can be consulted to help with developing insightful generalized advise as well as individual plans for each person using the software. 
   
  My personal interest in this domain stems from my own personal struggles with developing healthier eating habits and maintaining consistent exercise routines. I have had two knee surgeries now (both in the same knee), which have made it difficult to stay active; however, I have been told that the best way to help my knee (and my body in general) is to maintain a healthy weight and build the muscles in my leg around my knee as much as possible. As such, I would need to perform exercises that focus on building calf, quad, inner, and outer thigh strength. Furthermore, I personally believe in the importance of preventative health. There are many health issues, both physical and mental, that can be prevented by having a healthy exercise regimend and diet; however, I recognize that it is difficult for some individuals to adopt healthier lifestyles, as it often requires a major commitment to change your lifestyle that is more difficult to retain the more that life "gets in the way" so to say. Another reason that this problem resonates with me is that I have tried different diets before in which I was mislead to believing that I would lose weight much faster than I saw it actually leave. It is extremely disheartening when you have strictly been following a diet, only to see the number on the scale not change (or even go up), after spending copious amounts of time, money, and effort to follow a specific diet. Continuing to stick with the diet after not seeing any changes, or only seeing miniscule changes, is extremely difficult to do. I believe that if people are able to research different kinds of diets and choose one based off of what will be best for them as individuals, as well as build their own personal exercise programs, then it will make it easier for them to make the lifestyle change and to keep it. 
  
   I believe that the best platform to prototype this with would be a mobile app and/or a website, and the system that I have chosen to prototype this with is an incremental prototype. In the incremental prototype, the developer breaks down the several pieces which are them all developed separately, and then brought back together. This will be useful to developing this specific software, as the software's design can be broken down into pieces such as the nutritional section, the food data tracking section, the and the exercise development section. This would allow me to focus on each individual section and the challenges that will be faced developing it. Once each individual section is completed, I can shift the focus to integrating them, and resolve the issues that arise there as the appear.
